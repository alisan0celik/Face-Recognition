# Face Recognition with Keras and OpenCV

This project demonstrates face recognition using a pre-trained Keras model and OpenCV. It recognizes faces in real-time through a webcam.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:


- OpenCV
- TensorFlow (for Keras)

## Usage
Run datacollect.py. 1000 images of the faces of the desired people with the camera will be saved in the file with the entered name. 

[Train link](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) You will train an artificial intelligence using the images obtained with the help of this site.Then call the trained AI in main.py and run main.py. On the screen that opens, you will see that the trained faces are recognized.
